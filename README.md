## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/papers-to-code.git
cd papers-to-code

# Install common dependencies
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib tqdm jupyter numpy
```

### Quick Start with Vision Transformer

```bash
cd Vision_Transformer
python train.py
```

Each implementation includes:
- **Clean PyTorch code** with modular architecture
